## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm YiÄŸit, it's pronounced like the English word yeat or the meme word yeet.

I'm a data scientist with a few years of industry experience. I started to study for a Master's in Econometrics in Technical University of Dortmund (TU Dortmund).

My Bachelor's was in Business Administration and I have an entrepreneurial mindset. 
These days I'm working on a few personal projects of mine, just to get some more experience in other fields of data science. 
Maybe one of them grows to be something bigger, who knows?

Hope you like or benefit from what you find in my GitHub profile!
If you'd like to collaborate with me, I'm always open to hear what you've got on your mind :)
